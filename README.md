<strong>G-OS 2.0 is finally here!</strong><br>
Yesssssss, G-OS 2 is actually here! Do some stuff in this OS that is entirely made by JS and HTML (and obviously the style from CSS).

<strong>What's G-OS?</strong><br>
G-OS is a teeny tiny OS that is entirely made by JS, HTML, and CSS, and G-OS also allows you passwords too!

<strong>How to get in when I forget my password?</strong><br>
Read "HOW TO GET IN IF PASSWORD IS FORGOTTEN.md" for more information.


<strong>How to download G-OS?</strong><br>
You don't entirely <strong>download</strong> it, but you can upload it, and double press "G-OS 2.0" or "G-OS", both of them are particularly the same, but more features (G-OS 2.0) and squashed bugs.
